# Installing Nyssa

Setting up Nyssa is a very straight forward process that involves three easy steps.

1. Download the Nyssa package manager from [the official Nyssa website](https://nyssa.bladelang.com) or from [the Github repository releases page](https://github.com/blade-lang/nyssa/releases). It is recommended to download from the Nyssa website as the website will only have the most stable release for download.
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a choice location on your device.
3. Add the location of the extracted package to your system environment path to make the `nyssa` command available system-wide (This step is optional).

Various operating systems provides different mechanisms for adding a path to the environment so the steps may vary for your specific operating system.

Here's a few links for different operating systems showing how to do this.
